# CVBuilder
A simple cv/resume building webpage. It allows you to put your data and get a pdf version of your resume, simple and clean. You can make a spanish and english version of it and also export/import the data to continue later. No data is stored anywhere, everything happens locally.
It's a project I had on my mind for over a year or two, now I got to make it cause I need it. Expect and embrace errors, bad code and practices and even ugly bugs, it's real, not perfect, hope it comes in handy to someone.
